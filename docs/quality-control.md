# Quality Control

## Overview
The Quality Control module manages quality assurance processes throughout the production lifecycle. It ensures products meet specified quality standards through systematic inspection, testing, and deviation management.

## Features

### 1. Quality Inspection Management
- Inspection plan creation
- Quality parameter definition
- Sampling plan management
- Test method specification
- Acceptance criteria setting
- Inspection scheduling

### 2. Batch Review Workflow
The batch review process follows a structured four-step workflow:

#### Step 1: Batch Data Review
- Review logged parameters (temperature, pH, pressure, yield)
- Analyze deviation summary with severity levels (Critical, Major, Minor)
- Verify manufacturing process compliance
- Approve batch for release

#### Step 2: Batch Finalization
- Update batch status to "Released"
- Generate comprehensive batch report (21 CFR Part 11 compliant)
- Notify supply chain team for logistics planning
- Archive batch data for regulatory compliance

#### Step 3: Shipment Readiness
- Update batch status to "Ready for Shipment"
- Warehouse team notification for inventory pickup
- Confirm shipment readiness
- Track logistics and delivery status

#### Step 4: Post-Production Analysis
- Review performance metrics (completion time, quality compliance)
- Access root cause analysis for any deviations
- Optimize future production schedules
- Generate analytics for continuous improvement

### 3. Quality Check Execution
- In-process inspections
- Final product testing
- Parameter measurement
- Visual inspection recording
- Automated test integration
- Results documentation

### 3. Deviation Management
- Deviation detection
- Root cause analysis
- Corrective action tracking
- Preventive measures
- Impact assessment
- Resolution workflow

### 4. Quality Documentation
- Test reports generation
- Certificate of Analysis (CoA)
- Non-conformance reports
- Corrective action reports
- Audit documentation
- Regulatory compliance records

### 5. Quality Metrics
- First pass yield
- Defect rates
- Quality costs
- Process capability
- Inspection efficiency
- Compliance rates

### 6. Compliance Management
- Standard operating procedures
- Regulatory requirements
- Industry standards
- Quality certifications
- Audit management
- Documentation control

### 7. Laboratory Information Management
- Test request handling
- Sample management
- Result recording
- Method validation
- Instrument calibration
- Reagent management
